/**
 * A pipe is a class annotated with the @Injectable() decorator, which implements the PipeTransform interface.
 *
 * Pipes have two typical use cases:
 * - transformation: transform input data to the desired form (e.g., from string to integer)
 * - validation: evaluate input data and if valid, simply pass it through unchanged; otherwise, throw an exception
 *
 * In both cases, pipes operate on the arguments being processed by a controller route handler.
 * Nest interposes a pipe just before a method is invoked,
 * and the pipe receives the arguments destined for the method and operates on them.
 * Any transformation or validation operation takes place at that time,
 * after which the route handler is invoked with any (potentially) transformed arguments.
 *
 * PipeTransform<T, R> is a generic interface that must be implemented by any pipe.
 * The generic interface uses T to indicate the type of the input value,
 * and R to indicate the return type of the transform() method.
